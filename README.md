- About the dataset and Survey
The dataset originates from a 10-minute online survey completed by 25,090 professional and student developers. The survey was conducted between October 16 and November 1, 2017, using SurveyMonkey as the hosting platform. Respondents were recruited through email outreach to a community of over 3.4 million members and various social media channels.

The dataset provides insights into the tech industry, focusing on gender-based data. It includes details on participants' degree specializations, job roles, and coding experience, offering a comparative perspective between men and women in technology.

##  Observations from data analysis -
- ### Degree Focus
- Men and women in the tech industry tend to have different academic backgrounds. Men are more likely to pursue degrees in Computer Science, while women are more inclined toward degrees in Information Technology.
- ### Job Roles
-  Men and women in the tech industry often occupy different job roles. Men are more commonly found in senior-level positions, whereas women are more frequently represented in junior-level roles.
- ### Coding Experience
-  Men and women in tech exhibit varying levels of coding experience. Men are more likely to have begun coding at a younger age compared to women.

## **Recommendations**
1. **Promote Computer Science Education**: Encourage more women to pursue degrees in Computer Science and related disciplines through targeted outreach and awareness campaigns.
2. **Mentorship Programs**: Establish mentorship and leadership initiatives specifically designed to support and empower women in technology.
3. **Skill Development Opportunities**: Provide coding training and mentorship programs to help women enhance their technical skills and gain valuable coding experience.
